## Credits

This project includes configuration files for Ranger that were adapted from the [Archcraft Skeleton](https://github.com/archcraft-os/archcraft-skeleton/) repository. Special thanks to the Archcraft for their original work and inspiration.

### Requirements

- Terminal: Kitty
- Package: `highlight`

## Why?

Original repository's image preview doesn't work on wayland. So, I made few changes to make it work on X11 and Wayland. `Highlight` package is required for code preview with syntax highlighting.
